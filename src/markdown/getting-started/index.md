## Get to know **Lenra**

Lenra is an open source framework to create your app using any language, and deploy it without any Ops scale, built on ethical values.
Our framework is based on four parts: data, views, listeners, and users.

    ### Data
    Without data, there is no app. That's why our framework starts with data. We believe that data should be simple and easy to understand.

    ### Views
    The views are what the user sees and interacts with. It should be clear and concise. It should be easy to use and navigate.

    ### Users
    They are the ones who will use our apps and benefit from them. We believe that all apps should be designed with the user in mind.

    ### Listeners
    Listeners are what make an app interactive. They listen for user input and then respond accordingly.
